# MSAppsTest

This application gets a JSON file (https://api.androidhive.info/json/movies.json),
parse it to SQLite database and display it as a list (RecyclerView), ordered by the movies' release year (from new to old).
The app can also scan JSON QR code (like this: https://bit.ly/3funEjX) and add it to the SQLite database.
